# Swampy Library Installation
In order ro run the code from swampyExercises folder you need to install the swampy library for Python 3!

If you **don't know how** to do this, just google it: _https://goo.gl/jjaVIW_

**_Update_** - 
Due the problems installing the library, files have been added to **Solved Exercises/1st Guide/Swampy Exercises** folder, which allow you to run the files without installing the swampy library. 

However, you **must run** the following commands **before** running the files:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

# Cherry Py Library Installation
In order to run code in exercises **_ex34, ex35 and ex36_**, you need to install the **_cherry py_** library for Python 3!

The most easy way to install this is via **_pip_** (if you don't have pip installed just google it):
```
$ pip install cherrypy 
```
